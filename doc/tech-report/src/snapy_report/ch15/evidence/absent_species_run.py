"""Zero in, zero out in the solver: an absent species under the implicit step.

This is a RUN record, not one of the chapter's checks: it needs a built snapy
in the active Python and is not part of `src/tests`. The committed check
`src/snapy_report/ch15/checks/invariants_zero_check.py` makes the same claim on
a port of the operators and needs nothing but numpy; this one makes it on the
compiled code, with the implicit vertical solve, the moist conserved limiter
and the cross-panel exchange that the port does not carry.

Six gnomonic-equiangular panels of the same shell as `aam_budget_run.py`, with
a four-species moist thermodynamics (dry, NH3, H2S, NH4SH) and the NH3 + H2S
nucleation of `tests/test_condensate_conservation.yaml`. NH3 is PRESENT and is
the control; H2S and its condensate NH4SH are ABSENT, set to exactly zero.
A warm bubble drives vertical motion, so the implicit x1 solve, the positivity
limiter and the species transport all do real work on the present row.

Each cycle it records, over the interiors of all six panels,

  min and count of non-zeros of each absent species row
  min of the present species row  (the limiter's own guarantee)
  the global mass of each species row

The exact answer is that an absent row stays bitwise zero for any number of
steps. A non-zero entry in an absent row is the kintera #147/#151 defect class
appearing in snapy.

What keeps it zero HERE is the zero flux, not the limiter's rectifier, and this
record must not be credited with testing the latter. An identically zero row
reconstructs to zero on both sides of every face, so its species flux is zero,
so `out` and `drain` are zero, so `flux_positivity_theta` returns 1 from the
`else` branch of its `torch::where(drain > 0., ...)` (flux_positivity.cpp:69-71)
and never evaluates the rectified numerator at all. Measured at the pin with the
function instrumented: over the 162 limiter calls of three cycles the two absent
channels have max drain exactly 0.0 and zero cells with drain > 0, while the
present control channel reaches 2.274e+13 over 2456 cells. Consequently, with
`u.relu()` replaced by `u.clamp_min(1e-300)` in the built library this record
still ends GREEN on both CPU and CUDA -- it is insensitive to that term by
construction.

The rectifier is tested instead by `[Z1]` of the committed check, which
prescribes the absent row's face fluxes directly and so can put it in the
draining state the solver will not produce on its own.

Two break arms put the defect into the deck the only way a Python driver can,
through the initial state and the switches:

  --break floor-seed   the two absent rows start at 1e-300 instead of 0, which
                       is what a kintera-style concentration floor would leave
                       behind: the row is no longer absent, so theta is no
                       longer exactly zero and the limiter's bound becomes a
                       relative one at a magnitude where its 4096-eps margin
                       underflows
  --break no-limiter   the same seed with `limiter: false`, so nothing repairs
                       the row at all

A break arm is expected to end RED, and exits nonzero when it does.

  python3 src/snapy_report/ch15/evidence/absent_species_run.py \
      [--device cpu|cuda] [--nx 8] [--cycles 200] [--scheme 9] [--json PATH]
  python3 src/snapy_report/ch15/evidence/absent_species_run.py --break floor-seed

Exits 0 when every absent row is still exactly zero at the end, 1 otherwise;
under `--break` the two are swapped, so a green run of the arm is the failure.
