"""Note references of STYLE 3.2 in a .qmd (editor's ruling 1791657615): `docs/derivations/<file>@<full sha>` is exempt
from the code-citation form of STYLE 3.1, and only that form. The sha must be the full 40 characters and the file
must exist at it; a short sha, a file outside docs/derivations, or a line range is not a note reference.

fixtures/notes.qmd, by line: 1 note at the pin (passes); 2 the same with a short sha; 3 a script with an output
label (passes); 4 a note that does not exist at the sha; 5 a code file in the note form; 6 a note with lines.
Needs the network unless CHECK_CITATIONS_CACHE holds the pin. Run from the report directory:
`python3 -m pytest tools/tests`.
